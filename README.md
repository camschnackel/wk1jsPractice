### Week 1 Javascript Practice: Edabit

The purpose of this Edabit problem was to create a function that would receive
an **array** and return the **lowest value** contained within the array. After
unsuccessfully trying a number of loops and if statements, I came across
**spread syntax**. It allowed me to solve the problem but to be honest, I
couldn't find an explanation on it's purpose that I could understand. I'd
love to know exactly what this is doing.
